I did the assignment by myslef with the help of CPSC 223 staff in office hours.

DISCUSSION

One of the major challenges I experienced while doing the assignment was handling the different states. It required careful attention so that my states transition as required in order to do what the problem requires. I also had to learn to use buffers to store the tag names,attribute names and their values because they were necessary to ensure I am looking at valid tags. After I was done, I realised I needed to handle cases where there is a comma in the values. I had a bit of trouble writing a replace_commas function that would scan through the value buffers and then replace a comma with "&comma;". Generally, I had a lot of fun doing the pset because it really reminded me a lot of things about the C language. It was indeed satisfying to crack the code way before the deadline.
